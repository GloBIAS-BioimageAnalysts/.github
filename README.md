Overview - Global BioImage Analysts' Society

# The Global BioImage Analysts’ Society (GloBIAS)

The Global BioImage Analysts’ Society (GloBIAS) aims to be a worldwide association that brings together all those interested in bioimage analysis.

The society will enable learning and knowledge exchange between members. This will be achieved by a number of different tools, such as online events, in-person workshops, and online repositories.

GloBIAS will be a non-profit association that is expected to be officially constituted during 2024. The foundation of the society is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to the project "Society for Knowledge Exchange in BioImage Analysis" until September 2025, after which the aim is for the Society to be self-sustained through membership fees and activities.
