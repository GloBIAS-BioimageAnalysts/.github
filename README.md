Overview - Global BioImage Analysts' Society

# The Global BioImage Analysts’ Society (GloBIAS)

The Global BioImage Analysts’ Society (GloBIAS) is a registered association that is active worldwide and brings together all those interested in bioimage analysis.

The society enables learning and knowledge exchange between members. This is achieved by a number of different tools, such as online events, in-person workshops, and online repositories.

GloBIAS is a non-profit association that was officially constituted in October 2024, and is registered in Klosterneuburg, Austria. The foundation of the society is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to the project "Society for Knowledge Exchange in BioImage Analysis" until December 2025, after which the aim is for the Society to be self-sustained through membership fees and activities.
